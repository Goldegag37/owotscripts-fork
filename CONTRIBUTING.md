# Contribution Guidelines
I do not accept new scripts; after all, this is supposed to be a collection of *my* scripts!
However, if you'd like to improve on an existing one, feel free to make a pull request; please make sure to update the version number if you do so.

## Versioning Rules
* If you are **adding, changing, or removing** features, increment the major version. *(Example.: 3.1 -> 4)*
* If you are **fixing, or optimizing** existing features, increment the minor version. *(Example: 2 -> 2.1)*
* If you are just changing the code formatting or comments, you do not need to change the version number.
